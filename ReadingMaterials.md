[Models in biology: ‘accurate descriptions of our pathetic thinking’](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-12-29#Sec9)



### General 

- Biological problem ALWAYS as the lead `ask a question`

- Quantitative models is one of the useful tool 

  ```plain
  We do not model or use a method for the sake of itself, but only use it as a tool in solving a specific (or, fortunately, a class of similar) problems
  ```

  

### Models

- **Logical Structure**

  - **Assumption** `model building`

    - Classes of models

      - Phenomenon based models `guesswork`
      - fundatmental physics based models `current knowledge dependent`

    - Issues concerning the models

      - parsimony vs details `more complex,less explained`

        - Parameter constraint (free parameter settings through data)

      - testing systems - Micro ? Macro `phenomenon at cell level != tissue/organism level`

      - fitting the model `if it cannot be falsified, it is not telling you anything`

        

  - **Mathematical techniques**

  - **Conclusions predictions**

  - **Testing**

    - Through cross validation 
    - Different methods lead to the same conclusion
    - Through experiment
      - In `some particular (especially engineerable) fields` of biology only



### Personal thinking

a work flow as follows:

- A problem arising from reality

  - with social & financial significance `Are we truly concerned about and solving the very problem in urgent need of resolution?`

    - in biomedical field, pursuit of good health and high life quality conform to general morality

    - good health of the common public requires lower costs in sense of finance, and the application of scientific findings concerning a majority of people, not only a rare or previleged part of them

      

- We decide to solve the problem, first through science 

  - The design of exploration pipeline 

    - reasonable assumption

      - Requirement: background knowlege
      - But :sometimes sense, sometimes pure luck or coincidence-driven
      - Type : forward(model >> exp testing) OR backward(phenomenon driven >> model >> testing, which is general in clinical research)

    - Experiment

      - Type: wet & dry

      - Wet lab

        - act as discovery source

          - Accidental and quick, but only for some of the lucky dogs who got luck and careful & insightful enough with the details : (the story of penicillin and sea urchin)
          - For many, a tedious and long……. Procedure , picking a needle in the sea by screening 
            - But , this process can be accelerated if:
              - There comes a new source of technique that proves effective! (single cell seq,for example); but it may also be expensive or hard to operate or not applicable in a new bio-model, and it also brings new issues to be handled
              - The protocol is optimized by some responsible technicians/companies
              - You have the best equipments(packages from bio-companies) so as to save time and improve experiment quality(but they might also be expensive)
              - You, yourself has gained good experimental skills through _hard_ practice, so that you conduct those basic ones neatly and quickly(but sometimes a rush does not serve any good, quality matters first; so at the same time, a strong body to withstand long time of exp work is also required)

           

        - act as confirmation

          - In some cases, dry lab without wet confirmations is just assumptions
          - It depends on whether you have a good model/assumptions
          - But most of the time, you just got nothing -- given you have got reliable exp skills, you just analysis the possible step of wrongs(debugging) and start over

          

      - Dry lab

        - Forward: modeling under certain assumptions; Backward: accumulating and analysis of  data to find possible significance(statistic works)
        - Basic statistic tables, Graphic production, Resources orgnization, Text edition, File arrangement
